**The punniest of holidays.**

Valentine's Day is my favorite holiday for chocolate sculpting. There are endless puns to play with and the themes are always fun. This year I went with the whale pun because apparently I have a thing for ocean themes? 🤔

The base, whales, and waves are 100% chocolate and painted with colored cocoa butter. The ocean floor sand is brown sugar.

What do you think of "whale you be mine"?
