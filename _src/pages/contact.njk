Hello lovely people I have some news! **I've recently switched careers and am no longer working with chocolate.**

Leaving the world of chocolate was a terribly difficult decision, but it was time for a change. What's next for me? I went back to school and earned my teacher's license to become a K-12 art teacher. I can't overstate the impact my art teachers had on me and it felt like the right time to give back.

Does that mean I'm finished with chocolate? No! But at least for now I'm no longer taking custom sculpture requests.
