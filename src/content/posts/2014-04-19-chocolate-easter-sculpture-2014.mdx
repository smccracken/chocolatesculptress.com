Easter is a great holiday for chocolate sculptures. Even though winter tends to hold on through April in Vermont, Easter is one of those symbols that spring is on its way.

For this sculpture I used a 3-egg stack sitting on a bed of white chocolate straw. Making the straw was a lot of fun and I love the texture it brings to the piece. The bird on top is my favorite though.
