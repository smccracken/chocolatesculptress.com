I made a chocolate "thank you" card for Roy Feldman from the SEABA community. I had a lot of fun making this one, especially using the "Art Hop" logo as the bridge.

SEABA is the south end arts and business association. They help foster and promote the arts district in Burlington, VT's south end.

The arts community around here is nothing short of incredible. I feel inspired to work on chocolate art in this community because of all the amazing artists and creative minds that I'm surrounded by. SEABA is largely to thank for making sure the community continues to thrive.
