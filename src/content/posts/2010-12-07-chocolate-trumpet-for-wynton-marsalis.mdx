Wynton Marsalis, the world's best living jazz trumpet player, was in town a few years back for Burlington's Discover Jazz festival. To celebrate I made a chocolate him a chocolate trumpet. I was sad I didn't get to meet him, but it was cool to see this picture of him backstage with the sculpture before his show!
