From retail shops to restaurants, one common theme I see across Vermont is an emphasis on local. Local artists, farmers, and food.

The _[Chocolates of Vermont](http://www.lakechamplainchocolates.com/assortments/chocolates-of-vermont/)_ assortment from Lake Champlain Chocolates celebrates local flavors by featuring honey from local hives, cream from farmers we know, and maple syrup â€¦ oh man, the maple syrup.

This piece is a celebration of that chocolate celebration ... in more chocolate. It's like chocolate inception ðŸ˜‚
