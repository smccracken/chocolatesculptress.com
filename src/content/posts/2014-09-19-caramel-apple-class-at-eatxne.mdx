[Eat by Northeast (ExNE)](http://eatxne.com/about/) is a FREE 3-day celebration of Vermont food and local food organizations. The weekend (09/19/14 - 09/21/14) will feature delicious local food, beers and ciders, as well as free music. Have I mentioned how I much I love Vermont?

There will be over 30 free seminars from chefs and food enthusiasts who will teach you how to take advantage of everything the Vermont food shed has to offer. Speaking of which...

## Kids -- Come Make Your Own Caramel Apples

It's apple season, everyone! Come out to Oakledge park and dip some caramel apples with me and Chef Lauren. The apples are from just down the road and the caramel is made from local ingredients, and we think that makes them taste even better. The session is for kids, but I encourage parents to taste test anything their kids make. You can call it a "parent tax" or part of the "cause I said so clause" ... I won't tell.

The session is at Oakledge Park in Burlington, VT and will take place on Sunday, September 21st from 3:00pm - 3:45pm. Here's the event description:

> _Celebrate the local apple harvest with a Vermont fresh caramel splash! Learn how to make a fabulous caramel at home using the best ingredients available â€“ local butter, milk, and heavy cream. Pick your favorite local apple, dunk it in warm caramel and roll it through nuts and chocolate._

The event is free, but please make sure to [reserve your FREE SPOT on EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/kids-come-make-your-own-caramel-apples-tickets-12474975989%20#btv) to make sure there's a spot for your child.
