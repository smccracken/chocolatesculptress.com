It's late April in Vermont and that means it's snowing, naturally. But before today's unwelcome storm we did have a taste of the warm sun and vibrant colors of spring.

Those warmer thoughts are what inspired my [springtime chocolate sculpture](/sculptures/chickens-and-an-egg/).

I learned how to make this 3D, hollowed out egg while attending a class with the masterful (and wonderful) [Derrick Tu Tan Pho](http://www.derrickphotutan.com/) back in 2008.
