I was on maternity leave during last year's [Grand Point North](http://www.grandpointnorth.com/), so I was really looking forward to this year's festival. That excitement only grew when I found out that [Grace Potter and Matt Burr](http://www.gracepotter.com/) had requested a chocolate sculpture to be delivered to the show!

I've had the [pleasure of working with them in the past](https://www.chocolatesculptress.com/sculptures/grace-potter) so I wanted to make something a bit different this time around. Something to welcome them home to Vermont. As I thought about it more, the answer seemed obvious -- the GPN logo. I can only imagine how much effort and coordination it takes to producing a festival like GPN. The band pays particular interest to local musicians, artists and food and I've always respected that. So for this year's sculpture I kept it simple and celebrated the festival. My favorite part? Those white chocolate wings and each individual chocolate feather.

I'm hoping that Grace and the guys had a chance to enjoy this sculpture as a post-show snack. I already have some great ideas in mind for GPN 2015 if they're looking for their next chocolate fix.
