On October 23rd, 2012 one of my chocolate signs made an appearance on the Dr. Oz show, the episode was titled "[Have Medicine's Most Controversial Leaders Found the Fountain of Youth?](https://www.doctoroz.com/episode/have-medicines-most-controversial-leaders-found-fountain-youth?video_id=1919603813001)"

I met chocolatier [Håkan Mårtensson](https://www.hakannyc.com/) who makes incredible chocolate pieces.

While my chocolate "Dr. Oz logo" only made an appearance for a few seconds, it was a wonderful experience. Plus, I'll never forget how stressful it was driving chocolate sculptures 6 hours from northern VT down to New York City in the back of the car! Luckily everything made it there in one piece.
