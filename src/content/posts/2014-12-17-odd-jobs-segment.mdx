Many thanks to Jennifer Costa for [coming by the chocolate factory](http://www.wcax.com/story/27640986/odd-jobs-chocolate-sculptor) and filming me at work for her "Odd Jobs" segment on WCAX. Jennifer is traveling around Vermont and highlighting hard-working or creative people with unusual careers. I love that my career is considered unusual. I wouldn't have it any other way. You can watch the segment here.

> _“McCracken’s loved three dimensional art for as long as she can remember. But after graduating art school, a degree in 3D illustration and ceramics wasn’t paying the bills. So, she traded clay for cocoa and took a job managing the chocolate company’s retail store. That is until her bosses discovered her background. – Jennifer Costa”
