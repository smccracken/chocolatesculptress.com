<b>As seen on the "[Outrageous Chocolate](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/outrageous/episodes/chocolate)" special on Food Network!</b>

This towering 5-foot tall, 65+ pound cuckoo clock is a real showstopper—crafted from over 65 pounds of luscious chocolate, it’s equal parts sweet and spectacular. Not only does it look like it stepped right out of a vintage candy shop window, but it’s also a fully functioning clock that keeps time better than your grandma’s old wristwatch (and way tastier, too!). Complete with charming little chocolate birds, this sculpture is a whimsical nod to the good ol’ days, wrapped up in a deliciously modern twist.

Landing a spot on Food Network’s "Outrageous Chocolate" special was the cherry on top of this chocolate sundae! Big thanks to Lake Champlain Chocolates and my amazing friends and family who believed this sweet dream could come true.

While the gears aren’t quite 100% chocolate (hey, we’re still waiting on that sweet tech breakthrough!), this clock is a delicious reminder that with a little creativity and a lot of heart, you can turn any moment into a timeless classic. So, whether you’re a chocoholic or a timekeeper, this sculpture is sure to make your heart—and your sweet tooth—tick!
