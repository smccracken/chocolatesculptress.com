Every year, Día de Muertos is a chance to celebrate the ones we’ve lost and keep their memories alive — and I wanted to honor that beautiful tradition with chocolate.

These sculptures aim to bring together the artistry, flavor, and tradition of the day. From the majestic Catrina in her orange dress, to the delicate sugar-skull details, each piece is a sweet tribute to those we hold close in our hearts.

One very special corner of the display is a loving tribute to my Boston Terrier, Eiffel, the bestest boy a person could ask for. His soulful eyes and charming expression are captured in rich chocolate, proving that our furry friends are a big part of our families, too. All these sculptures blend artistry, flavor, and deep sentiment — honoring the past while adding a little happiness to the present.

Because sometimes the best way to remember is with something made from the heart… and a whole lot of chocolate!
