🍫🦕 I hope everyone had a dino-mite Valentine's Day! It's alaways been one of my favorite holidays for many reasons, not least of which is the adbundance of good puns we can use to say how we feel.

This sculpture features a cute dinosaur pearched on a tree of hearts. The dinosaur's body was made using shell molding and I just love how it turned out.
