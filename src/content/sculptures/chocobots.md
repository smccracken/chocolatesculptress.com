Chocolate + Robots = Chocobots.

Back in 2007, I brought this whimsical equation to life at the South End Art Hop in Burlington, Vermont, where my chocolate exhibit celebrated the sweet intersection of nostalgia and imagination. I sculpted a small army of retro-futuristic robots entirely out of rich, glossy chocolate&#8212;think Jetsons meets Willy Wonka.

It was a love letter to mid-century sci-fi wrapped in a cocoa shell, designed to tickle the taste buds and the funny bone.

The only thing missing was a marshmallow jetpack.
