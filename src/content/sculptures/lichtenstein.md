**My 2012 chocolate exhibit for the Burlington, VT South End Art Hop was a tribute to one of my favorite artists -- Roy Lichtenstein.**

Roy Lichentenstein was an American pop artist, who used vibrant, bold colors and retro-inspired themes that have always captured my attention.

Replicating his work in chocolate was not easy. First, chocolate and bright bold colors don't always mesh. I always want my sculptures to be 100% edible, so I had to experiment with edible dyes that had enough power to get the effect I was going for.

Another interesting challenge was how some of Lichtenstein's most famous sculptures had see through elements which I tried to bring to my work as well.

I'm hoping someday to make it to his exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City to gain even more inspiration from this art icon.
