Norman Collins, known as "Sailor Jerry", was an American artist famous for tattooing sailors. His tattoos used a revolutionary blend of vivid colors and bold icons, which has influenced the tattoo industry ever since. Even if you've never heard his name, I'm betting you've [seen his work](http://sailorjerry.com/en/tattoos/flash-meanings/).

I've always been drawn to Sailor Jerry's art. First, it bleeds Americana and the 1950's --- which, if you know anything about me, is my favorite time period. But I also love his use of symbolism:

* Swallows represent the idea of returning home
* Sailors looking for stability in an ever-moving sea can turn to anchors for security
* Ships represent the call for adventure and Jerry always made sure to represent them accurately
* Hearts help keep loved ones close while you're out at sea (we've all seen the heart wrapped in a banner labeled Mom)
* Sailors looking for guidance can turn to nautical stars to guide them.

I tried to work in some of those symbols into my sculpture.
