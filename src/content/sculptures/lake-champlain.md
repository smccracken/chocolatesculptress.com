These sculptures are all inspired by Lake Champlain, one of Vermont's most treasured resources and [Lake Champlain Chocolates](http//www.lakechamplainchocolates.com)' namesake. They are all 100% chocolate and painted with colored cocoa butter. Thank you to everyone who came out to see them at Art Hop 2019. üêüü¶Ü‚õµÔ∏è

I'm really proud of how this shadow-box of Lake Champlain's fish came out. It features a Yellow Perch, Striped Bass, and Land-locked Atlantic Salmon. Each fish was cut out of chocolate and then hand-painted using various shades of colored-cocoa butter.
