Step right up, folks, and feast your eyes on <b>The Tastiest Show on Earth!</b>

For the 2018 [South End Art Hop](/topics/arthop/), I created a miniature three-ring spectacle entirely out of chocolate. The centerpiece? A striped Big Top tent complete with a dapper ringmaster and marquee that invited visitors to “Welcome to the Big Top”. Towering stars, candy-colored stripes, and a jaunty blue flag made it clear—this wasn’t your average dessert. It was pure spectacle, piped and molded into life with theatrical flair.

From a rotating chocolate carousel with hand-painted animals to a strongman sculpted out of dark chocolate flexing his (candy) muscles, every inch of the show was crafted with a wink and a whisk.

It was circus kitsch meets edible art, a nostalgic nod to popcorn-scented tents and sideshow wonder, only this time, everything was better with chocolate.
