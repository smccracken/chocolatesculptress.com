If there’s one thing that gets my creative engine running, it’s nostalgia—and nothing captures that better than the great American road trip. These chocolate sculptures are some of the pieces I’m most proud of, inspired by the quirky charm of roadside Americana and the sweet taste of memory. Each one is crafted entirely out of chocolate (yes, even the tiny poker chips and pine trees!), paying homage to iconic destinations that have earned their stripes on the map and in our hearts.

From the glitz of the Las Vegas strip—with its edible poker chips, playing cards, and roulette wheel—to the rustic serenity of Yellowstone National Park, complete with chocolate pines and a vintage camper trailer, these sculptures are a visual and culinary journey across the U.S. I even recreated the legendary Route 66 and its classic Blue Swallow Motel, gas pump and all—because what’s a road trip without a pit stop and a little kitsch? Each detail is designed to transport you somewhere familiar, yet fantastical, all while satisfying your sweet tooth.

These pieces are my chocolate love letter to the open road—where every pit stop is a memory, every detour a story, and every mile a mix of magic and sugar. I’ve always believed art should be fun, a little over-the-top, and ideally, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. So buckle up, grab a snack (maybe a chunk of chocolate), and enjoy the ride—because life’s too short for bland roads and boring candy.
