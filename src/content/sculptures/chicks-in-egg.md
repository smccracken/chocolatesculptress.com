Easter came a bit earlier than normal this year. Not that I'm complaining though, making Easter sculptures always gives me a chance to think warmer thoughts (even if the temperature is hovering around freezing).

I wanted to move beyond-the-bunnyâ„¢ this year. So instead of a rabbit, I went with a chicken-and-egg theme. I just wish I had written down which one I made first.
