**Do you wanna build a snowman … if he’s made of chocolate, the answer is always YES.** ⛄🍫

Meet Frosty’s sweeter cousin—crafted head to toe in chocolate and ready to melt hearts (but hopefully not himself). With his classic top hat, carrot nose, and jolly grin, this frosty fellow proves that winter magic can be both whimsical and delicious.

He’s less “cold as ice” and more “cocoa delight,” standing tall as proof that sometimes the best snow days are the ones you can eat. ❄️✨
