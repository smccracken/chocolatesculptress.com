Burlington, VT, is a vibrant artistic community that inspires creativity at every turn. Each September, the South End Art Hop transforms the south end of the city into a lively celebration of local art. Streets are closed, allowing art lovers to stroll from building to building, admiring the diverse works created by local artists.

Having worked in the south end, I had the unique opportunity to create chocolate art for display during this festival. It was an honor to participate in such a beloved annual tradition, blending my passion for art with the joy of crafting something delicious.

The South End Art Hop truly showcases the creativity that unites our community in Burlington.
