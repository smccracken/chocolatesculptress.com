# About Emily, the Chocolate Sculptress

As I shift focus professionally I am–at least for now–no longer making chocolate sculptures. It was a difficult decision, to say the least, but I'm excited for the future. Follow along over on my personal website if you're interested in where I land next.

Previously I worked for Lake Champlain Chocolates for 20 years where I focused on retail specialty products, taught chocolate bar classes, and created chocolate sculptures for their stores.
Over the years I've studied chocolate technique at the New England Culinary Institute, the Notter School of Pastry Arts, and the Barry Callebaut Chocolate Academy.

My chocolate career highlights:
* A sculpture on display for Sweet Tooth: The Art of Dessert exhibit at Shelburne Museum.
* Featured on Food Network's Outrageous Chocolate special.
* Custom sculptures for Wynton Marsalis, Ben & Jerry, and Grace Potter.
* Vermont Chocolate Show presentation.
* Mastercard's priceless picks campaign selection.
