        <p>Hi there, I'm Emily üëãüèª I am a former chocolate artist turned full time elementary art educator!</p>
        <h2>How do you even get started making chocolate art?</h2>
        <p>
          Good question! Sometimes I ask myself the same thing. Believe it or not, for me it all began with not fitting
          in at art school and a hazelnut truffle.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my artistic journey at Montserrat College of Art, majoring in Illustration. However, my true passion
          lay beyond 2D art. During an illustration assignment, I dared to sculpt my project in clay, and to my
          surprise, my professor encouraged me to embrace this new direction. Suddenly, I was the messy, clay-covered
          artist in a sea of traditional illustrators, and I loved every moment of it.
        </p>

        <h3>The Sweet Breakthrough</h3>
        <p>
          After graduation, I faced the daunting task of finding work that utilized my sculpting skills. Armed with a
          stack of resumes, I wandered Church Street in Burlington, Vermont, feeling disheartened. Just when I needed a
          boost, a hazelnut truffle from Lake Champlain Chocolates caught my eye. The employee suggested I apply for a
          part-time job, and soon, I was managing the factory store, surrounded by the sweet scent of chocolate.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting Creative</h3>
        <p>
          While managing the store was wonderful, I craved more. My boss saw potential in my 3D art skills and
          encouraged me to explore chocolate sculpting. After attending several chocolate classes, I was hooked! I
          realized I wanted to become a chocolate sculptress, with dreams of showcasing my work on the Food Network.

        <h2>Twenty Years of Working with Chocolate</h2>
        <p>

          about chocolate. I created eye-catching displays, participated in local art festivals, and studied competitors
          on Food Network shows. My passion flourished as I taught classes and shared my love for chocolate with others.
