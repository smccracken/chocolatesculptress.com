      <h1 class="headline">How Do You Even Get Started Sculpting with Chocolate?</h1>
      <p>
        Good question! Sometimes I ask myself the same thing. Believe it or not, for me it all began with not fitting in
        at art school and a hazelnut truffle.

      <h2>Finding Chocolate</h2>
      <p>
        I started my artistic journey at Montserrat College of Art, majoring in Illustration. However, my true passion
        lay beyond 2D art. During an illustration assignment, I dared to sculpt my project in clay, and to my surprise,
        my professor encouraged me to embrace this new direction. Suddenly, I was the messy, clay-covered artist in a
        sea of traditional illustrators, and I loved every moment of it.

      <h3>The Sweet Breakthrough</h3>
      <p>
        After graduation, I faced the daunting task of finding work that utilized my sculpting skills. Armed with a
        stack of resumes, I wandered Church Street in Burlington, Vermont, feeling disheartened. Just when I needed a
        boost, a hazelnut truffle from Lake Champlain Chocolates caught my eye. The employee suggested I apply for a
        part-time job, and soon, I was managing the factory store, surrounded by the sweet scent of chocolate.

      <h3>Getting Creative</h3>
      <p>
        While managing the store was wonderful, I craved more. My boss saw potential in my 3D art skills and encouraged
        me to explore chocolate sculpting. After attending several chocolate classes, I was hooked! I realized I wanted
        to become a chocolate sculptress, with dreams of showcasing my work on the Food Network.
